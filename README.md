The idea of this app is to represent hunting portal, 
that every hunter that have registration, who wants or has already been on hunt to
upload his trophy if he has one or to upload location where he was on hunt.

Application contain two collections one for trophy and for location.

Every logged in user can upload, edit and delete his on items.

There is connecton with two external API's one for checking the weather
and one for finding location on the map.

In server folder has two file "trophy.json" and "routes.json" that i filled in with initial data.
